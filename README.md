# RAYY take-home: partner discounts

Thanks for doing this. It is about two hours. If you reach two and a half
hours, stop and write in `NOTES.md` what is left and how you would finish it.
Use any tools you like, including AI; we care about what you ship and how you
checked it, not how it was typed.

## What you have

A small FastAPI service with one MongoDB collection, `orders`, a stub
payment-gateway client, seed data, and a test suite that currently passes.
Run it with `docker compose up`, or without Docker `make test` uses an
in-memory Mongo (note: the in-memory Mongo does not support transactions; if you
use them, say so in NOTES.md and we will run your tests against a real
replica set). All money in this codebase is integer paise.

## What to build

1. `POST /orders/{order_id}/apply-discount` with body `{ "code": "..." }`.
   Look the code up, apply it to the order, and record what was applied. Codes
   have a percentage, a cap in paise, an expiry, and a funding split between the
   partner and RAYY (for example 70/30).
2. `POST /webhooks/payment`. The gateway calls this when a payment succeeds,
   with a payment id, an order id and the amount charged. Mark the order paid
   and record the payment.
3. Tests for both, in the existing suite.
4. A small client, in Flutter or React: pick one, you do not need both, and
   say in `NOTES.md` which one you chose. Starters are in `client/flutter/`
   and `client/web/`; each builds and has one passing test. Given an order
   (the shape is in the starter):
   - write `formatPaise`, which turns integer paise into rupees with Indian
     digit grouping and exactly two decimals, using integer maths only:
     199999 is `₹1,999.99`, 12345678 is `₹1,23,456.78`, 5 is `₹0.05`. It
     throws on input it cannot format (a non-integer in TypeScript, a
     negative amount in Dart);
   - show the subtotal, the discount code and amount when there is one, and
     the total, all through `formatPaise`;
   - add a button labelled "Pay" that is disabled while a payment is in
     progress (it still reads "Pay"); it reads "Paid", and stays disabled,
     only when the order's status is `paid`;
   - if the payment fails, show an error (React: an element with
     `role="alert"`; Flutter: text containing "Payment failed") and let the
     customer try again.

   Add tests for it in the starter's test setup.
5. In `NOTES.md` (short bullets are fine), five lines: partners are settled
   monthly for their share of discounts, and a partner's split ratio can
   change next month. What do you store per order so this month's settlement
   is correct, and what does the settlement query read?
6. Also in `NOTES.md`: the one thing your AI tool got wrong that you caught;
   anything in your submission you would not yet trust in production; and
   roughly how long this took and where the time went.

Two things are deliberately not specified. Decide, and say what you decided
in `NOTES.md`: how you round when a percentage produces a fraction of a
paisa, and what happens when a second discount code is applied to an order
that already has one.

## Submitting

Within 48 hours, push your work to your own GitHub (public, or private with
read access for the account named in our email) and send us the link. Include
`NOTES.md` and your AI prompt history in a `prompts/` folder (a raw export or
screenshots is fine; no need to tidy it); we expect it with every submission.
If your tools do not keep a history, say so in NOTES.md and describe how you
used them. Keep pricing and money logic out of the route handlers; we read the
structure as well as the behaviour.
